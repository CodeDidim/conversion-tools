# Security Model

Repository visibility is controlled manually. Make the repository public only when you intend to push changes.

## Best Practices

- Keep private profile files outside of the repository.
- Enable two-factor authentication on GitHub.
- Review the diff after running `workflow.py public` to ensure no secrets remain.
- Limit write access to the public repository.
